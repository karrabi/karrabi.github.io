The Cross-Industry Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology consists of six stages:

1. **Business Understanding**: The primary objective of the Pathrise Data Science Project is to analyze and predict the outcomes of fellows within the Pathrise program. This involves understanding the key metrics that define success for the program, such as job placement rates, time to employment, and salary outcomes. By identifying these metrics, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can help improve the program’s effectiveness and enhance the success of its fellows. Key stakeholders include Pathrise program managers, mentors, and the fellows themselves, all of whom have a vested interest in the program’s success. The project seeks to address specific business questions, such as: What factors contribute to successful job placements? How can the program be optimized to reduce the time to employment? By answering these questions, the project aims to align its analysis and models with the strategic objectives of Pathrise, ultimately driving improvements in the program and delivering value to its stakeholders.


2. **Data Understanding**: 
    1. **Fellow Information**: This includes data on the fellows participating in the program, such as their educational background, work experience, and skills.
    2. **Program Metrics**: Data related to the fellows' progress through the Pathrise program, including participation in workshops, mentorship sessions, and other activities.
    3. **Job Application Data**: Information on the job applications submitted by the fellows, including the number of applications, companies applied to, and the stages reached in the application process.
    4. **Outcome Data**: This includes the final outcomes for the fellows, such as job placement rates, time to employment, and salary information.

3. **Data Preparation**: This involves preparing the final dataset for modeling by selecting, cleaning, and transforming data.
4. **Modeling**: Various modeling techniques are applied to the prepared data to create models that can achieve the project goals.
5. **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated to ensure they meet the business objectives and are effective.
6. **Deployment**: The final model is deployed into the operational environment, and the results are monitored and maintained.
